          <p class="card-text">
            TaskMate was born from a simple idea: to create a task management application that is more than just a list. We wanted to build a seamless experience that feels as good to use as it is effective. We are a small team dedicated to continuous improvement and listening to our users to make TaskMate the best tool for personal and professional organization.
